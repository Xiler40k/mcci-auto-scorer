# MCCI AUTO SCORER

## How it works

This mod takes in information from both the minecraft chat and scoreboard and compiles this into scores that are often used in spreadsheets for MCCI tournaments. This can be sent to the backend server, where the information can be processed and inputted into the spreadsheet to reduce the amount of automatic scoring requried.

Currently in development for:
ICC
MCCIT
